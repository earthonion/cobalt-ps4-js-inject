These three elements are given differing importance based on the type of search. To estimate relevance we look into many factors, such as how well the title, tags, description and video content match your search query. Engagement signals are a valuable way to determine relevance. We incorporate aggregate engagement signals from users, i.e. we may look at the watch time of a particular video for a particular query to determine if the video is considered relevant to the query by other users. Finally, for quality, our systems are designed to identify signals that can help determine which channels demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness on a given topic.
